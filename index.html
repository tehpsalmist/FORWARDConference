          <p>"Navigating the Road to College" can be a daunting process, particularly for a family going through this for the first time. It is an individual journey and there is no one "right way" to travel this path. Mitch will share with you about some of the keys to the admissions process, with an emphasis on the standardized testing component, starting with the PSAT in 9th, 10th, and/or 11th grades, followed by the SAT, ACT, and/or SAT subject tests, in 11th and/or 12th grades. He will also discuss merit money or gift aid and how that relates to grades and standardized test results.</p>
